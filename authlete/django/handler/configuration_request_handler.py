    "OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0".

    Note that the URI of an OpenID Provider configuration endpoint is defined
    in "4.1. OpenID Provider Configuration Request". In short, the URI must be

    "{Issuer-Identifier}" is a URL that identifies an OpenID Provider. For
    example, "https://example.com". For details about Issuer Identifier, see
    the description about the "issuer" metadata defined in "3. OpenID Provider
    Metadata" (OpenID Connecto Discovery 1.0) and the "iss" claim in
    "2. ID Token" (OpenID Connect Core 1.0).
